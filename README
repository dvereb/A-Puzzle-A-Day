# Order of Operations:
 When rendering, always perform the actions in this order:
 1. Flips, if set
 2. Rotation


# All Piece Placement Format:
 Assumes you're placing, in order, all pieces
 2 bits for flip, 2 bits for rotation, 6 bits for position, 8 times.
 10 * 8 = 80 bits.


# TODO(dev):
# Individual Piece Placement Format:
 3 bits for piece number (#0 - #7)
 2 bits for flip
  (first bit = horizontal flip on)
  (second bit = vertical flip on)
 2 bits for rotation
  (none, 90, 180, 270)
 6 bits for position
